#How to run

Install pynput with:
```
pip install pynput
```
Run the script with:
```
python keylogger.py
```
The script will run until you press the escape key. If you want to use this seriously you should delete those lines of code (line 31 and 32).
When the script is run, a file named log.txt will generate inside the same directory as the script. You can read through this to see what keys have been logged.
